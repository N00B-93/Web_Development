            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>
            This week I am extremely excited about a new 
            cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> 
            cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed 
            in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely 
            set to the target temperature you want the food 
            to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, 
            Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon 
                with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef 
                table, contact us before <date>November 30.</date>

                    <strong>Warning</strong>: Sous vide cooked salmon is not 
                    pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have 
                    immunity issues.
